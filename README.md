#This project is just for our thesis; it is built using React Native and only works with Android devices. 
What it does: It allows users to request any kind of emergency within the app, get their location and notify only the requested responder type and connects them, and gives them real-time update for both user and responder, generate directions by putting both of them on the map and implement chat system to keep in touch.
